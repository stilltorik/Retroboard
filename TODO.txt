Bugs:

- X Can't put down postits when scrolling happens.
- X We can unlock postits that we didn't lock ourselves
- X Locked postits remain locked if closing the window/tab
- X When a postit is outside the visible window at started, there is no scrollbar
- X If space in name, count of +s wrong
- X adding +s not reflected in other people windows
- some postits scroll, other don't. Why?
- X add autofocus on postit
- X Postit not updated when the user deletes everything
- scrolling not practical on Firefox
- X locking not always works
- X Disallow move on textarea
- X websockets unexpectedly closing
- bin instead of cross? at bottom? https://pixabay.com/en/icon-pack-package-icons-to-save-2129743/
